// A subclass of DestinyItemQuantity, that provides not just the item and its quantity but also information that BNet can - at some point - use internally to provide more robust runtime information about the item's qualities.  If you want it, please ask! We're just out of time to wire it up right now. Or a clever person just may do it with our existing endpoints.
type DestinyDefinitionsMilestonesDestinyMilestoneQuestRewardItem struct {
	// The quest reward item *may* be associated with a vendor. If so, this is that vendor. Use this hash to look up the DestinyVendorDefinition.
	VendorHash int32 `json:"vendorHash,omitempty"`
	// The quest reward item *may* be associated with a vendor. If so, this is the index of the item being sold, which we can use at runtime to find instanced item information for the reward item.
	VendorItemIndex int32 `json:"vendorItemIndex,omitempty"`
	// The hash identifier for the item in question. Use it to look up the item's DestinyInventoryItemDefinition.
	ItemHash int32 `json:"itemHash,omitempty"`
	// If this quantity is referring to a specific instance of an item, this will have the item's instance ID. Normally, this will be null.
	ItemInstanceId int64 `json:"itemInstanceId,omitempty"`
	// The amount of the item needed/available depending on the context of where DestinyItemQuantity is being used.
	Quantity int32 `json:"quantity,omitempty"`
