// Represents a \"raw\" investment stat, before calculated stats are calculated and before any DestinyStatGroupDefinition is applied to transform the stat into something closer to what you see in-game.  Because these won't match what you see in-game, consider carefully whether you really want to use these stats. I have left them in case someone can do something useful or interesting with the pre-processed statistics.
type DestinyDefinitionsDestinyItemInvestmentStatDefinition struct {
	// The hash identifier for the DestinyStatDefinition defining this stat.
	StatTypeHash uint32 `json:"statTypeHash,omitempty"`
	// The raw \"Investment\" value for the stat, before transformations are performed to turn this raw stat into stats that are displayed in the game UI.
	Value int32 `json:"value,omitempty"`
