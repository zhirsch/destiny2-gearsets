// Inventory Items can reward progression when actions are performed on them. A common example of this in Destiny 1 was Bounties, which would reward Experience on your Character and the like when you completed the bounty.  Note that this maps to a DestinyProgressionMappingDefinition, and *not* a DestinyProgressionDefinition directly. This is apparently so that multiple progressions can be granted progression points/experience at the same time.
type DestinyDefinitionsDestinyProgressionRewardDefinition struct {
	// The hash identifier of the DestinyProgressionMappingDefinition that contains the progressions for which experience should be applied.
	ProgressionMappingHash int32 `json:"progressionMappingHash,omitempty"`
	// The amount of experience to give to each of the mapped progressions.
	Amount int32 `json:"amount,omitempty"`
	// If true, the game's internal mechanisms to throttle progression should be applied.
	ApplyThrottles bool `json:"applyThrottles,omitempty"`
}
