	Hash int32 `json:"hash,omitempty"`
	// The type of entity, returned as a string matching the DestinyDefinition's contract class name. You'll have to have your own mapping from class names to actually looking up those definitions in the manifest databases.
	EntityType string `json:"entityType,omitempty"`
	// Basic display properties on the entity, so you don't have to look up the definition to show basic results for the item.

	// The ranking value for sorting that we calculated using our relevance formula. This will hopefully get better with time and iteration.
