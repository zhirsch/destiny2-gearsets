# destiny2-gearsets
Lists the gearsets for a Destiny 2 character.

## Prerequisites

In order for this to work for your character, you need to [make your
inventory public] at (check the "Show my non-equipped Inventory" box).
I'm not sure what all the consequences of doing this are, so do so at
your own risk!

You'll also need to [assign yourself an API key].

## Example command line

```shell
$ go run gearsets.go -user zhirsch -apikey <apikey>
```
